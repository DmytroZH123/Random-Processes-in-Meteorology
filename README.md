# Random-Processes-in-Meteorology
Climate change is the observed and projected long-term changes in average climate, as well as climate variability, caused by human activity, including such anomalies as droughts, severe storms and floods.

The climate of our planet has been constantly changing throughout the entire geological history of the Earth, and these changes were accompanied by significant fluctuations in average global temperatures. One of the main drivers of global average temperature change is the burning of fossil fuels, coal, gas and oil, which has increased the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

The use of temperature prediction models is of great practical importance, starting from predicting the temperature for the next year for sowing, crop yields, etc. Everything directly helps to solve the problem of hunger on a global scale.
